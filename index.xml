      <title>Integrating TeamCity with Microsoft Teams using PowerShell</title>

      <description>With the beginning of new year I joined a new team where I help with project bootstrapping. I&amp;rsquo;ve been configuring TeamCity, Gitlab and webservers. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time for me to work with Gitlab, so I started looking around and checking what opportunities come to me with that tool. One of my discoveries was the &amp;ldquo;Integration&amp;rdquo; bookmark, allowing me to connect Gitlab with other systems. I checked a list of possible integrations and found that it could communicate with Microsoft Teams chat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently watched a pretty decent tutorial about DSC on Microsoft Virtual Academy. I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of video tutorials because it always takes more time to watch them than read a book/blog post (you can hack it by increasing video speed and save yourself a couple of minutes) but sometimes there is additional beneficial side effect - the presenter can show you (accidentally or not) some tips and tricks not strictly related to the core subject of the video.</description>

      <title>Get rid of TODOs from your codebase.</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently written an article about managing TODOs in the codebase with TODOExplorer. I&amp;rsquo;ve also proposed an idea of introducing code snippet for TODOs which helps to keep all TODOs in predefined format as well as provides more information about delayed task (author, receiver, date, issue tracker id). This article was a result of a few discussions with my programmer-colleagues and I hoped that that idea of TODOs snippet was worth sharing (I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it in my project for a while).</description>

      <title>The fastest way do debug .net code without sources.</title>

      <description>Some people used to say that a good programmer doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to debug his own code. However, sometimes we have a problem with third party libraries usage, for example: there is insufficient documentation or the module contains some bugs. Visual Studio has excellent debugging toolset but this is totally useless without symbols and sources (and this is often the case with third party libraries). Thanks to Reshaper decompiler this shouldn’t be a problem anymore.</description>

      <title>How to manage TODO in your codebase.</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to make all things done at the first approach. But in the real world it&amp;rsquo;s not always possible - for example we need to ask customer for clarification and it will take some time, or worst - we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time right now to implement things in the right way. In order to adress this issue, a TODO was invented to mark all those places in code requiring additional work.</description>

      <title>Why clicking with Selenium is so hard.</title>

      <description>When I browse StackOverflow questions tagged with selenium label, a lot of them are related to the problem of clicking on page elements. It seems to be one of the most trivial tasks, but can cause a lot of problems. Very often invoking Click() action on webelement ends with exceptions (there is a wide range of them). The main reason is that element on which we try to click is not in &amp;ldquo;Interactable&amp;rdquo; state.</description>

      <description>I started programming at 10 years old trying to retype some simple Basic programs from an old user guide to my C-64. It was just a temporary hobby but a few years later I bought a programmer magazine with C++ Builder on CD and started to write my first real programs. In high school I got interested in web development using Html, JavaScript and PHP. I graduated from the University of Science and Technology AGH (Kraków, Poland).</description>

      <title>Hunt your bugs in design time</title>

      <description>Static analysis is a powerful feature of Visual Studio that helps us to spot syntax and semantic errors in our code. It works very well on currently edited file and runs on the whole solution as one of the compilation stages. But it would be a waste of time to run compilation every time you make changes that affect code outside currently edited file, only to check that you didn&amp;rsquo;t cause any compilation errors.</description>

      <title>Save your history - TortoiseSVN and &#34;Repair move&#34; option.</title>
      <link>https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/my-first-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TortoiseSVN has a function named simply “rename” which allows you to change the file name and keep the file history as well. But what if we change the file name for example during refactoring using Visual Studio? Are we fated to lose file history? Fortunately TortoiseSVN has an interesting option called “repair move”.

      <title>Don&#39;t write dull code - Resharper Live Templates</title>
      <link>https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/livetemplates/</link>

      <description>One of the greatest features of Resharper are Live Templates. They can speed up your code typing and help you focus only on what is most important (you don’t need to remember and retype anymore long ‘dull’ code constructions). Live Templates are similar to Visual Studio code snippets but are easier to define and introduce smart parameters that help you in faster code completion.
Template Explorer You can manage Live Templates in Templates Explorer from RESHARPER menu (RESHARPER -&amp;gt; Template Explorer&amp;hellip;).</description>
