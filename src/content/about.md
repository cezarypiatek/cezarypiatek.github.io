I started programming at 10 years old trying to retype some simple Basic programs from an old user guide to my C-64. It was just a temporary hobby but a few years later I bought a programmer magazine with C++ Builder on CD and started to write my first real programs. In high school I got interested in web development using Html, JavaScript and PHP. I graduated from the University of Science and Technology AGH (Kraków, Poland). At university, I didn’t learn too much useful stuff but I’ve got a basic knowledge of C, C++, Java and algorithms. In my free time I’ve started to learn C# and getting familiar with Microsoft .Net platform. I am currently employed as a professional software developer for a private company in Kraków. I’ve been working on desktop and web based software development using Microsoft .Net platform and attending projects using WPF, Silverlight and MVC frameworks. Nowadays, I am trying to get to know F# and Windows Phone platform. I love hardcore music and skateboarding (ice-skating in winter).
