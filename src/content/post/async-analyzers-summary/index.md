In the last two posts I've described 14 different code smells related to the `async/await` keywords. Besides the problem description I've also provided info about code analyzers which are able to detect and report a given issue. Those analyzer comes from few different packages that are not strictly devoted to the asynchronous programming area. They contain also rules from other fields with predefined severity which might not be appropriate to your needs or you might not be interested in enforcing them at all. The fact that those analyzers comes from different packages provided by different community members results in duplicated effort (some rules were implemented more than once) and force us to spend more time researching then and deciding which one to use. **I wish there was a single analyzer package that contains all those rules related to async programming, and only them.** This will result in better time disposition of people who works on the analyzers (in most cases, they are doing it in their spare time without getting paid for it), increasing analyzers quality and definitely simplify the consumption. Right now we need to somehow deal with what we have. To save you some time and to finally answer the question **"Which analyzer package should I use and how to configure it to avoid problems related to async/await?"** I decided to write this summary. 

## Installing the analyzers

Here's the entries for `csproj` that add async analyzers to your project.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="AsyncFixer" Version="1.3.0">
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="Asyncify" Version="0.9.7" >
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="Meziantou.Analyzer" Version="1.0.570">
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers" Version="3.3.0">
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers" Version="16.8.50" >
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="Roslynator.Analyzers" Version="3.0.0">
        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
        <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

If you install analyzer packages manually using Nuget UI or CLI then you might notice that some package references are decorated with
`PrivateAssets` as well as `IncludeAssets` properties. This is due to the fact that packages were marked as [DevelopmentDependency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#developmentdependency). **I think the lack of those attributes is rather an overlook and you can safely add them for analyzer references which are missing them** - they do not provide any runtime dependencies which will be required to run your app or library. **If you do not add it, those packages became your dependencies which is rather not expected:**

> I decided to not use `Roslyn.Analyzers` package because the maintainer is not responding to Github Issues and PRs. No activity since 2017 so the project looks dead to me.




## Configuring the rules

You can have two options. You can leave the default settings as they are and progressively adjust it to your need or you can set them all to none and the increase the severity for the rules that you are interested in. You can easily set the severity for multiple rules at once using a context menu in the Solution Explorer:




//TODO: Present how to set those rules.
