      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer but I don&amp;rsquo;t like to write code. OK, it&amp;rsquo;s not the whole truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to write the code that is repeatable. Whenever I need to do something more than twice, I start thinking about automation. Hopefully, this problem can be addressed with code snippets. Visual Studio provides a predefined set of snippets that can be extended, but if you are a Resharper user you should definitely get to know LiveTemplates because it&amp;rsquo;s more powerful and easier to configure.</description>

      <description>A year ago, during my trip to one of Software developer conferences, I got a lot of opportunities to discuss variety of topics related to software architecture. Most of them concerned CQRS and CQS patterns. I heard about them many times before but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a chance to use them in practice. After getting back from the conference, I decided to give it a shot and try to introduce it in one of my private projects.</description>

      <title>How to manage TODO in your codebase.</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to make all things done at the first approach. But in the real world it&amp;rsquo;s not always possible - for example we need to ask customer for clarification and it will take some time, or worst - we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time right now to implement things in the right way. In order to adress this issue, a TODO was invented to mark all those places in code requiring additional work.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t write dull code - Resharper Live Templates</title>
      <link>https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/livetemplates/</link>

      <description>One of the greatest features of Resharper are Live Templates. They can speed up your code typing and help you focus only on what is most important (you don’t need to remember and retype anymore long ‘dull’ code constructions). Live Templates are similar to Visual Studio code snippets but are easier to define and introduce smart parameters that help you in faster code completion.
Template Explorer You can manage Live Templates in Templates Explorer from RESHARPER menu (RESHARPER -&amp;gt; Template Explorer&amp;hellip;).</description>
