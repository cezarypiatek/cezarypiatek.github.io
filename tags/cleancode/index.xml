      <description>jquery.unobtrusive-ajax is the javascript library that every ASP.NET MVC developer certainly knows. It&amp;rsquo;s shipped with MVC bootstrapping template and it&amp;rsquo;s responsible for providing plumbing code which helps to add ajax functionality to rendered forms and links. Unfortunately, it has a few design drawbacks which could have negative impact on our system architecture and generate additional hidden costs. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you some of jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js related problems I encountered in my 5-year journey as a ASP.</description>

      <description>The idea behind this blog post is pretty old but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had enough motivation to write this down till now. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve came across a couple of new articles about AutoMapper and I&amp;rsquo;ve been struck when I saw how people utilize AutoMapper in their projects. I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered cases when AutoMapper transforms simple thing like mapping values from object to other into a really complex problem, which results with highly complicated code only for the price of not writing mappings explicitly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently written an article about managing TODOs in the codebase with TODOExplorer. I&amp;rsquo;ve also proposed an idea of introducing code snippet for TODOs which helps to keep all TODOs in predefined format as well as provides more information about delayed task (author, receiver, date, issue tracker id). This article was a result of a few discussions with my programmer-colleagues and I hoped that that idea of TODOs snippet was worth sharing (I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it in my project for a while).</description>
