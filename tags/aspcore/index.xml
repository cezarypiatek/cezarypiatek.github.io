      <description>In the world of Kubernetes and microservices, diagnosing and debugging issues can be a challenging task. One powerful tool in your troubleshooting arsenal is memory dump analysis. Memory dumps capture the state of an application&amp;rsquo;s memory at a particular point in time, providing insights into potential issues, bottlenecks, and crashes. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the process of collecting a memory dump from a .NET Core application running on Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the second installment of my blog post series on WireMock.NET, I will be discussing some of the most common problems that developers encounter while using the library. WireMock troubleshooting can be quite time consuming, especially when you don&amp;rsquo;t know the drill. I hope that my guideline will save you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post, I discussed the use of dependency injection (DI) containers for mocking dependencies in tests for ASP.NET Core applications. While this approach is useful in some cases, I personally prefer using mocks/stubs/fakes that don&amp;rsquo;t require any changes in the app internals and work directly with the actual protocol used by the application being tested.
In this post, I will introduce to you WireMock.NET, a powerful tool for mocking HTTP requests.</description>

      <description>As I recently spent some time writing and refactoring tests that utilize WebApplicationFactory, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to have some thoughts and ideas for improvement that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the process of mocking dependencies in a DI container when using WebApplicationFactory, and offer some insights and best practices I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned pro or new to unit testing ASP.NET Core applications, I hope this information will be helpful as you work to simplify and streamline your tests.</description>

      <description>For the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve had an opportunity to work quite a lot with Component Tests for microservices built with ASP.NET Core. The vocabulary related to testing is very vague and terms like Unit, Component, and Integration tests can be interpreted differently based on the context, so let me explain first what I mean by Component Tests. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of test that treats your whole service as a black box.</description>

      <description>In the era of microservices and distributed systems, web browser applications written in JavaScript are not the only consumers of the REST API. Today, more and more often this type of communication is used to connect backend services, too. Integrating two services using REST protocol doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any form of shared contract which makes the process extremely easy when both sides are developed in different technologies but it comes at a price.</description>
