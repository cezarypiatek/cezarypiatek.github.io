|[CS0464](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/misc/CS0464)|Comparing with null of struct type always produces 'false'|
|[CS0472](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/misc/CS0472)|The result of the expression is always the same since a value of this type is never equal to 'null'|
|[CS1720](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/misc/CS1720)|Expression will always cause a System.NullReferenceException because the type's default value is null|
|CS8073|The result of the expression is always the same since a value of this type is never equal to 'null'|

|CS8609|Nullability of reference types in return type doesn't match overridden member.|
|CS8610|Nullability of reference types in type of parameter doesn't match overridden member.|

|CS8618|Non-nullable field is uninitialized. Consider declaring as nullable.|
|CS8619|Nullability of reference types in value doesn't match target type.|
|CS8620|Argument cannot be used for parameter due to differences in the nullability of reference types.|
|CS8621|Nullability of reference types in return type doesn't match the target delegate.|
|CS8622|Nullability of reference types in type of parameter doesn't match the target delegate.|
|CS8624|Argument cannot be used as an output for parameter due to differences in the nullability of reference types.|
|CS8625|Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type.|
|CS8626|The 'as' operator may produce a null value for a type parameter.|
|CS8629|Nullable value type may be null.|
|CS8631|The type cannot be used as type parameter in the generic type or method. Nullability of type argument doesn't match constraint type.|

|CS8643|Nullability of reference types in explicit interface specifier doesn't match interface implemented by the type.|
|CS8644|Type does not implement interface member. Nullability of reference types in interface implemented by the base type doesn't match.|
|CS8645|Interface is already listed in the interface list with different nullability of reference types.|
|CS8653|A default expression introduces a null value for a type parameter.|

|CS8655|The switch expression does not handle some null inputs.|
|CS8667|Partial method declarations have inconsistent nullability in constraints for type parameter|
|CS8714|The type cannot be used as type parameter in the generic type or method. Nullability of type argument doesn't match 'notnull' constraint.|
