      <description>10 years ago I published my first blog post entitled &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t write dull code&amp;rdquo; which was dedicated to a Resharper feature called LiveTemplates. It&amp;rsquo;s a code snippet engine that was originally introduced in Resharper, but is now also available in Rider. LiveTemplate comes with a set of predefined snippets for basic coding scenarios such as conditions, loops, exception handling, etc. However, the real power lies in the ability to create custom snippets with placeholders that can be completed manually or automatically by macros.</description>

      <description>In my journey through the nuances of API testing, I&amp;rsquo;ve often encountered the challenges and time-consuming aspects of creating accurate WireMock mappings. As developers, we often get bogged down in the details of the anatomy of inter-service communication, not to mention the frustrating typos that lead to inaccurate mappings. In this blog post, I will introduce a powerful solution: the WireMock.NET proxy. This feature completely changes the way we approach mapping preparation, significantly reducing both workload and debugging time.</description>

      <title>Mocking GraphQL queries with WireMock.NET</title>
      <link>https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/mocking-graphql-with-wiremock/</link>

      <guid>https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/mocking-graphql-with-wiremock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly what they need, making data retrieval more efficient than traditional REST APIs. It supports three different types of client-server interaction: queries, mutations and subscriptions. When you start integrating a GraphQL API as a consumer in your application, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to write automated tests to ensure that the integration works correctly. In this blog post, I will show you how to mock GraphQL queries using WireMock.NET.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As .NET developers, we understand the significance of writing automated tests to ensure our applications function correctly. However, as our applications grow more complex and diverse, optimizing the test process becomes crucial. One effective approach is reusing components like tested application and WiremockServer instances between test cases. While this optimization can improve test efficiency, it can also introduce challenges of ensuring that different test cases do not interfere with each other.</description>

      <description>In the world of Kubernetes and microservices, diagnosing and debugging issues can be a challenging task. One powerful tool in your troubleshooting arsenal is memory dump analysis. Memory dumps capture the state of an application&amp;rsquo;s memory at a particular point in time, providing insights into potential issues, bottlenecks, and crashes. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the process of collecting a memory dump from a .NET Core application running on Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post, I discussed the use of dependency injection (DI) containers for mocking dependencies in tests for ASP.NET Core applications. While this approach is useful in some cases, I personally prefer using mocks/stubs/fakes that don&amp;rsquo;t require any changes in the app internals and work directly with the actual protocol used by the application being tested.&#xA;In this post, I will introduce to you WireMock.NET, a powerful tool for mocking HTTP requests.</description>

      <description>As I recently spent some time writing and refactoring tests that utilize WebApplicationFactory, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to have some thoughts and ideas for improvement that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the process of mocking dependencies in a DI container when using WebApplicationFactory, and offer some insights and best practices I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned pro or new to unit testing ASP.NET Core applications, I hope this information will be helpful as you work to simplify and streamline your tests.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is not to criticize the MediatR library. MediatR is a tool - and just like any tool, it has its own scope of application, and being used incorrectly might do more harm than good. This blog post summarizes my thoughts about using MediatR for supporting CQRS architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to share my experience on testing &lt;code&gt;ASP.NET Core&lt;/code&gt; applications by applying an unconventional method called &lt;code&gt;snapshot assertions&lt;/code&gt;. In comparison to the classical approach, this method should save you a lot of time and improve assertions maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A while ago I came across &amp;ldquo;Quick notes on a rant&amp;rdquo; authored by Don Syme. This rant criticizes the C# language for the lack of a few important features. The first point is &amp;quot;Implicitly discarding information is so 20th Century&amp;quot; which brings our attention to one of the sources of bugs in C# programs. Lucky me, I got the pleasure to make this kind of bug and find it later in production code, so this blog post is to save you the trouble.</description>

      <description>I discovered the power of Roslyn over three years ago and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve developed three Visual Studio extensions and a couple of code analyzers. Because I work on those tools only in my free time, the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; is a key here, so automation really matters. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been using AppVeyor for building and testing my extensions. However, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of integrated solutions because they require much less work for setup, and since GithubActions became generally available I wanted to give it a try.</description>

      <description>In the last two posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve described 14 different code smells related to the async/await keywords. Beside the problem description, I&amp;rsquo;ve also provided info about code analyzers that can detect and report given issue. Those analyzers come from a few different packages that are not strictly devoted to the asynchronous programming area. They also contain rules from other fields with predefined severity, which might not be appropriate to your needs, or you might not be interested in enforcing them at all.</description>

      <description>This blog post continues the series which is a guide through the code analyzers available on the market and their possibilities. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to help you answer the question: &amp;ldquo;Which analyzer package should I use and how to configure it to avoid problems related to async/await?&amp;rdquo;. In the previous episode, I presented the first seven most common code smells related to asynchronous programming. Today, I present the next seven traps from this area.</description>

      <description>Roslyn analyzers are great. Not only do they detect different issues in our code, but they are also able to propose solutions, thanks to accompanying code fixes. There&amp;rsquo;s one more, less-advertised aspect of analyzers: besides improving the quality of our codebase, they also improve the state of language knowledge in our teams. This is a real time-saver during the code review because the technical, language-related remarks are reported automatically in design/build time.</description>

      <description>A year ago I started working on a set of projects that requires accessing data from a huge legacy database. There was a decision to use Dapper to facilitate database access code. For those of you who are not familiar with Dapper, it&amp;rsquo;s a set of extension methods to IDbConnection, which allows to easily map C# object to SQL query parameters, as well as SQL query result to C# objects. I was quite skeptical to use a library that requires writing SQL queries directly in the C# code, because I got used to relying always on ORMs (NHibernate in particular).</description>

      <guid>https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/methods-with-special-signature/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a certain set of special method signatures in C# which have particular support on the language level. Methods with those signatures allow for using a special syntax which has several benefits. For example, we can use them to simplify our code or create DSL to express a solution to our domain-specific problem in a much cleaner way. I came across those methods in different places, so I decided to create a blog post to summarize all my discoveries on this subject.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a simple CRUD service. A mix of ASP Core for REST API with Dapper for Database access - probably one of the most popular stacks for this kind of application. Very quickly it turned out that it&amp;rsquo;s more complex than I expected and this &amp;ldquo;simple-boring&amp;rdquo; CRUD became more interesting and challenging.&#xA;The Problem 🔗&amp;#xFE0E;&#xD;One of the first problems that I came across was that I had a lot of types that looked very similar but had some differences and served different purposes, like:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I started using non-nullable reference types - a new C# language feature which was shipped with version 8.0. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a completely new experience for me, because I was working before on projects that were heavily utilizing [NotNull] and [CanBeNull] Resharper annotations. The way how non-nullable types are handled by Roslyn seems to be a little more complex in comparison to Resharper - there are around 40 different diagnostics related to this area.</description>

      <description>Over a year ago I wrote a blog post about designing exceptions. I found this article very useful by myself and I used it as a reference a few times during code review. However, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to expect that, after reading the recommended resource, anybody would start to apply described rules immediately and remember about them all the time. It&amp;rsquo;s a learning process and it takes some time. A while ago I got interested with Roslyn (I even delivered a public presentation about it - polish recording available here) and there is a really cool thing about Roslyn analyzers that can solve this problem - they help to actively introduce best practices into your codebase.</description>

      <description>In the early days of dotnet core, there was an attempt of changing the C# project file format. The old &amp;ldquo;csproj&amp;rdquo; based on XML format was replaced with .xproj/project.json. However, after releasing dotnet core 1.0 the authors decided to get back to XML file. The format stayed the same but the specification went through a major change. With the new schema, a lot of improvements come into .net development and they are not restricted only to dotnet core projects.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been in a situation when you discovered an exception in the logs that forced you to spend the next couple of minutes - or even hours - figuring out what exactly went wrong? The message was very cryptic and the only useful information that guided you to the crime scene was a stack trace. And after arriving there, you still had no idea what had really happened and what was the culprit.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I posted about negative aspects of applying AutoMapper. As an alternative I suggested typing all mapping code by hand or utilize some kind of generator like T4Scaffoling or something Roslyn based. In the past I experimented with T4Scaffoling but it was quite tedious. It requires preparation of templates in T4 syntax, referencing it to the project and writing some PowerShell code to provide data for templates. There also was an issue with assembly locking.</description>

      <description>The idea behind this blog post is pretty old but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had enough motivation to write this down till now. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve came across a couple of new articles about AutoMapper and I&amp;rsquo;ve been struck when I saw how people utilize AutoMapper in their projects. I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered cases when AutoMapper transforms simple thing like mapping values from object to other into a really complex problem, which results with highly complicated code only for the price of not writing mappings explicitly.</description>
